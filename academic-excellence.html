          <h2>The Challenge We Face</h2>
          <p>Across Texas, far too many school districts are grappling with failing academic ratings, low proficiency scores, and widening achievement gaps. Parents are frustrated, educators are stretched thin, and students are graduating without the foundational skills they need to succeed in college, careers, or civic life. These challenges aren't isolated—they're systemic. And they demand leadership that understands both the urgency and the complexity of fixing what's broken.</p>
          
          <h2>Amy's Proven Leadership</h2>
          <p>Amy Bundgus is uniquely equipped to meet this moment. Her experience on a local school board has given her a front-row seat to the realities families face—from curriculum transparency to accountability and resource allocation. But what sets her apart is her 20+ years leading global learning and leadership development in corporate America, where she built programs that trained and empowered over 220,000 employees. She knows how to design systems that work, measure outcomes that matter, and scale excellence across diverse populations.</p>
          
          <h2>Vision for Excellence</h2>
          <p>Texas needs a leader who can bridge vision with execution—and Amy delivers both. She brings strategic clarity, a results-driven mindset, and a deep commitment to empowering students through rigorous, fact-based education. Her background in learning frameworks, project management, and organizational development positions her to raise academic standards statewide and restore confidence in our public schools. Where others see problems, Amy sees potential—and she's ready to lead Texas students toward a stronger future.</p>
