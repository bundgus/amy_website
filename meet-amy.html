          <p>Raised on a family farm, Amy Bundgus learned early the value of hard work, faith, and service to community. After moving to Texas over 20 years ago, she built a distinguished career in banking and finance—leading global learning and leadership development for over 220,000 employees. Her work focused on empowering people through education, strengthening organizational culture, and driving measurable outcomes across complex systems.</p>
          <p>Amy brought that same strategic mindset to public service as a Trustee on the Denton ISD Board, where she earned a reputation for boldly standing up for parents, championing Texas values, and demanding transparency in curriculum and governance. Her leadership bridged corporate expertise with grassroots advocacy—always putting students and families first.</p>
          <p>As a mother and longtime advocate for academic excellence, Amy understands the importance of rigorous coursework, fair and accurate testing standards, and performance accountability. She believes the State Board of Education must set clear expectations that prepare students for the future while respecting the voices of parents and communities.</p>
          <p>Amy is committed to serve as a principled, solutions-focused voice for students, parents, and educators. She will work to raise reading and math proficiency, expand high-quality career and technical education pathways, and promote civics education that unites students around our shared Texas and American ideals.</p>
