          <h2>Standing Firm for Values</h2>
          <p>Amy Bundgus stands firm in her commitment to uphold conservative values in Texas education—values rooted in tradition, personal responsibility, and respect for family and faith. She believes that schools should reinforce the principles that have long guided strong communities: discipline, merit, and moral clarity. Education should empower students with truth, not confuse them with ideological agendas. Amy is determined to ensure that curriculum reflects the values parents hold dear, rather than undermining them with politicized content or social experimentation.</p>
          
          <h2>Fighting Against Bias</h2>
          <p>Across Texas and the nation, families have raised the alarm over biased academic materials—especially in library selections and classroom content that promote Critical Race Theory and divisive identity politics. Amy has been on the front lines of this fight, reviewing library catalogs, challenging inappropriate materials, and advocating for transparency in curriculum decisions. She's worked with parents and educators to expose content that distorts history, injects racial bias, or pushes activism over academics. Her approach is clear-eyed and unapologetic: every book, lesson, and resource must serve students' intellectual growth, not political indoctrination.</p>
          
          <h2>Watchdog Precision</h2>
          <p>With her strategic background and relentless attention to detail, Amy will bring a watchdog's precision to the State Board of Education. She'll scrutinize curriculum line by line, ensuring that Texas students receive a fact-based, values-driven education that honors our heritage and prepares them for the future. Amy knows that conservative values aren't just talking points—they're the backbone of a thriving society. And she'll fight every day to make sure Texas classrooms reflect that truth.</p>
