          <h2>The Erosion of Truth</h2>
          <p>Sadly, we've all seen growing concern over the erosion of truth in our classrooms—especially in subjects like civics, history, and science. Families are alarmed by curriculum that distorts foundational facts, omits key historical context, or pushes ideological narratives over objective learning. These issues aren't just academic—they shape how students understand their country, their rights, and the world around them. When truth is compromised in education, trust is lost, and students are left unprepared to think critically or engage responsibly in society.</p>
          
          <h2>Amy's Commitment to Truth</h2>
          <p>Amy Bundgus is committed to restoring truth and transparency in the Texas curriculum. With her sharp strategic mind and deep respect for fact-based instruction, she will bring an eagle eye to every detail—scrutinizing textbooks, lesson plans, and instructional materials to ensure they reflect accuracy, balance, and integrity. Her background in learning development has trained her to spot inconsistencies and elevate standards, and she'll apply that same precision to protect Texas students from misinformation and bias.</p>
          
          <h2>Foundation for Freedom</h2>
          <p>Amy believes that truth in teaching isn't negotiable—it's the foundation of a strong, informed, and free society. Students deserve to learn authentic history, understand the principles that built our nation, and develop critical thinking skills based on facts, not ideology. Her vision is clear: restore curriculum that honors truth, promotes understanding, and prepares students to be informed citizens who can distinguish between fact and opinion.</p>
