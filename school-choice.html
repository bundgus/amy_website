          <h2>Educational Freedom for All</h2>
          <p>Whether it's public school, private school, charter programs, Christian education, or homeschooling, parents deserve the final say in how their children are taught and raised. School choice isn't a threat to public education—it's a recognition that one size doesn't fit all. In a state as diverse and dynamic as Texas, empowering families with options is essential to ensuring every child has the opportunity to thrive.</p>
          
          <h2>Amy's Commitment to Choice</h2>
          <p>Amy Bundgus has long championed this principle. She deeply respects the dedication of homeschooling families and the faith-driven mission of Christian schools, recognizing the powerful role they play in shaping character, discipline, and academic excellence. At the same time, she believes in the strength and potential of Texas public schools, many of which have delivered outstanding results and life-changing opportunities for students. Amy's vision is not about choosing one model over another—it's about protecting the right of every family to choose what's best for them, while ensuring that public schools remain strong, transparent, and accountable.</p>
          
          <h2>Leadership for Educational Freedom</h2>
          <p>As a candidate for the Texas State Board of Education, Amy is committed to defending educational freedom while elevating standards across all systems. Her leadership blends respect for tradition with a bold push for innovation, ensuring that every child—regardless of their school setting—receives a rigorous, values-driven education. Amy knows that when families are trusted and empowered, students succeed. That's why she'll fight to protect school choice, strengthen public education, and ensure that Texas remains a place where parents—not bureaucrats—lead the way in shaping the future.</p>
