          <h2>The Growing Concern</h2>
          <p>Since COVID shined a spotlight on education across the nation, parents are raising serious concerns about the lack of transparency in public education—from unclear curriculum choices to limited input on what their children are being taught. Families feel sidelined, and many worry that their voices are no longer heard in decisions that directly impact their children's academic and moral development. These frustrations are compounded by inconsistent communication from school districts and a growing disconnect between classroom priorities and community values. The need for strong parental rights and curriculum transparency has never been more urgent.</p>
          
          <h2>Amy's Track Record</h2>
          <p>Amy Bundgus has been on the front lines of this fight. As a local ISD board member, she has consistently advocated for open dialogue between schools and families, pushing for clear curriculum reviews, accessible board policies, and parental involvement in decision-making. She challenged concerning instructional materials, demanded accountability from district leadership, and worked to ensure that parents are empowered—not excluded—from shaping their children's education. Amy believes that transparency isn't optional—it's foundational to trust, excellence, and student success.</p>
          
          <h2>Proven Leadership for Change</h2>
          <p>Her leadership is rooted in action, not rhetoric. With over 20 years of experience in learning and leadership development, Amy knows how to build systems that are both effective and accountable. She brings the strategic mindset to elevate academic standards and the courage to protect parental rights at the state level. As a candidate for the Texas State Board of Education, Amy is committed to restoring transparency, strengthening family engagement, and ensuring that every child receives a fact-based, values-driven education that reflects the priorities of their community.</p>
